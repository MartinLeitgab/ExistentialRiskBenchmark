  "req-1": "# Python\n\n**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, it has become one of the most popular programming languages worldwide.\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\n- **Easy to learn**: Clean, readable syntax that resembles natural English\n- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line-by-line, making debugging easier\n- **Dynamically typed**: No need to declare variable types explicitly\n- **Multi-paradigm**: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming\n- **Extensive libraries**: Rich standard library and vast ecosystem of third-party packages\n\n## Common Uses\n\n- **Web Development** (Django, Flask)\n- **Data Science & Analysis** (Pandas, NumPy)\n- **Machine Learning & AI** (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)\n- **Automation & Scripting**\n- **Scientific Computing**\n- **Game Development**\n- **Desktop Applications**\n\n## Simple Example\n\n```python\n# Hello World in Python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n# Variables and basic operations\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 30\nprint(f\"{name} is {age} years old\")\n```\n\nPython's philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, following the principle that \"there should be one obvious way to do it.\"",

  "req-3": "An **LLM** stands for **Large Language Model**. It's a type of AI system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language.\n\n## Key characteristics:\n\n**\"Large\"** - These models have billions (or even trillions) of parameters, which are like adjustable knobs that help the model recognize patterns in language.\n\n**\"Language\"** - They're specifically designed to work with text, learning grammar, facts, reasoning patterns, and even some coding abilities.\n\n**\"Model\"** - It's a mathematical system that predicts what words or phrases should come next based on patterns it learned during training.\n\n## How they work (simplified):\n\nLLMs are trained by reading enormous amounts of text from books, websites, and other sources. They learn to predict the next word in a sequence, and through this process, they pick up patterns about how language works, factual knowledge, and even reasoning abilities.\n\n## Examples:\n\n- GPT (like ChatGPT)\n- Claude (that's me!)\n- PaLM, LLaMA, and others\n\nThink of an LLM as having \"read\" a significant portion of the internet and learned to have conversations, answer questions, write code, and help with various tasks\u2014though it's important to remember it's pattern matching, not truly \"understanding\" like humans do.",

Larger models generally perform better at complex language tasks.\n\n## Examples:\n- GPT (like ChatGPT)\n- Claude (that's me!)\n- PaLM, LLaMA, and others\n\nThink of an LLM as having \"read\" a significant portion of the internet and learned to recognize and reproduce language patterns\u2014though it doesn't truly \"understand\" like humans do.
