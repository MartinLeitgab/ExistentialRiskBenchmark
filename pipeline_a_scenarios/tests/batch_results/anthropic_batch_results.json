  "req-1": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Here are its key characteristics:\n\n## Main Features\n\n- **Easy to learn and read**: Uses clean, English-like syntax that emphasizes readability\n- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line-by-line, making debugging easier\n- **Dynamically typed**: No need to declare variable types explicitly\n- **Multi-paradigm**: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles\n- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more\n\n## Common Uses\n\n- **Web Development** (Django, Flask)\n- **Data Science & Machine Learning** (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow)\n- **Automation & Scripting**\n- **Scientific Computing**\n- **Artificial Intelligence**\n- **Game Development**\n- **Desktop Applications**\n\n## Simple Example\n\n```python\n# Hello World in Python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n# Variables and basic operations\nname = \"Python\"\nyear = 1991\nprint(f\"{name} was created in {year}\")\n```\n\nPython's philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, following the principle that \"there should be one obvious way to do it.\" This makes it an excellent choice for beginners while remaining powerful enough for complex applications.",
