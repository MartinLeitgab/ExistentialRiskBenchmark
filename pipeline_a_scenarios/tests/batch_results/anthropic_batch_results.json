  "req-3": "# LLM: Large Language Model\n\nAn **LLM** is a type of AI system trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language.\n\n## Key characteristics:\n\n**\"Large\"** - These models have billions of parameters (the internal settings that determine how they work), making them much bigger than earlier AI systems.\n\n**\"Language\"** - They're specifically designed to work with text - reading, writing, translating, summarizing, and conversing.\n\n**\"Model\"** - They're mathematical systems that learn patterns from data rather than following explicit programmed rules.\n\n## How they work (simplified):\n\nLLMs learn by processing enormous amounts of text from books, websites, and other sources. They identify patterns in how words and concepts relate to each other, enabling them to:\n- Predict what word or phrase comes next\n- Understand context and meaning\n- Generate coherent, relevant responses\n\n## Common examples:\n- ChatGPT (OpenAI)\n- Claude (Anthropic) - that's me!\n- Gemini (Google)\n- Llama (Meta)\n\nThink of an LLM as having read a significant portion of the internet and learned to recognize patterns in language well enough to have conversations, answer questions, write content, and assist with various text-based tasks.",
